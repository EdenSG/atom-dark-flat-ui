Dark and flat UI theme for Atom.

The syntax theme used in the screenshot is [outlander-syntax](https://atom.io/packages/outlander-syntax)

## Note

As of version 0.6, only the Shadow DOM selectors are used, so Atom versions prior to v0.140 are not supported anymore. The layout hasn't changed, but if you're using an older version of Atom, you shouldn't upgrade this theme anymore.
